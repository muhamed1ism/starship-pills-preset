# Starship Configuration - Pills Preset

This repository contains a custom [Starship](https://starship.rs/) configuration file (`starship.toml`) to enhance your terminal prompt with a **Pills Preset** style, where each module appears inside colored pill-shaped segments.

## Preview

With this configuration, your prompt will display various information such as OS, username, current directory, git status, and programming environment details (e.g., Node.js, Python) in a clean and visually appealing pill format.

## Features

- **Pill-shaped segments** for each prompt module.
- Custom **color schemes** for different programming languages and git statuses.
- Show **OS icons** depending on the detected operating system.
- **Command duration**, **directory path**, **user**, and **hostname** in styled segments.
- Optional **multi-line format** for an organized prompt display.

## Configuration

### Requirements

- [Starship Prompt](https://starship.rs/): Ensure you have Starship installed.
- Compatible terminal with font support for symbols (e.g., Nerd Fonts).

### Installation

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/muhamed1ism/starship-pills-preset
   cp starship-pills-preset/starship.toml ~/.config/starship.toml
   ```

## Configuration Highlights

- **Command Timeout**: Commands that take more than 1.5 seconds (1500ms) show their duration.
- **Pill Color Coding**:
  - Language-specific colors for modules like Python, Node.js, Rust, etc.
  - Git status pill shows if the branch is ahead, behind, or diverged from the remote.
- **Directory Display**: Custom icons for specific folders (e.g., `Downloads`, `Documents`) to provide quick visual identification.
- **Host & Username**: Shown in pills with root users styled in a distinct color.
